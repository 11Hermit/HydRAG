The heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications Fire Tube Boiler Water Tube Boiler Challenges in a boiler 1. Corrosion- Weak acid formation corrodes boiler tubes and condensate line-High pH Corrosion Inhibitor 2. Corrosion caused by presence of dissolved oxygen in boiler feed water- Oxygen scavenger/Deaerators. 3. Scalling caused by heavy metal componds(Ca/Mg/Fe) - Scale inhibitors.
